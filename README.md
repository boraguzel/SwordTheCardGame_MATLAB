# SwordTheCardGame
Welcome to SwordTheCardGame, a MATLAB-based card guessing game where players test their luck and memory by guessing a card from a shuffled deck. This project is designed to provide an interactive and entertaining way to engage with MATLAB programming.

## Description
A MATLAB game where players guess a card from a shuffled deck. Features case-insensitive input, turn-based play, and simulates a full deck with four suits and ranks from Ace to King. Win by matching your guess with the drawn card. Fun and interactive for learning basic MATLAB operations.

## Features
Interactive Gameplay: Engage in a simple yet entertaining guessing game.
Case-Insensitive Input: Choose any card without worrying about case sensitivity.
Turn-Based Mechanics: The game alternates turns between the player and the computer.
Full Deck Simulation: Experience a game with a complete set of 52 playing cards.
# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
MATLAB (This game is compatible with most recent versions of MATLAB).
